# Queryable Codebase

A codebase is a graph. This system makes it queryable.

Every hard problem in large-scale software — security audits, performance optimization,
API documentation, dependency management, service decomposition — is currently solved by
humans reading files. This system makes those problems queries. Agents operate on the
graph directly. Text files, API specs, service boundaries, and deployment topologies are
all projections of the same underlying structure, materialized on demand.

---

## The core idea

Code is not text that happens to have structure. Code is structure that happens to be
renderable as text. The file tree is one possible view over the data — the one humans and
CI pipelines expect. It is not the canonical representation.

The canonical representation is a graph of symbols, nodes, and their relationships. From
that graph you can materialize:

- A conventional file tree (for git, CI, humans)
- Module interfaces (for consumers and type checking)
- An OpenAPI spec (generated from live route symbols, always current)
- A flat bundle (for edge deployment)
- Independent services (partitioned at clean module boundary cut points)
- A semantic changelog (symbol-level diff between versions, not line diffs)

The graph doesn't know or care which projection you choose. Agents operate on the graph.
Materialization is a rendering decision made at deploy time.

**The file is not the atom. The symbol is.**

## What this unlocks

Every interesting agentic task is either a reachability query or a join between runtime
behavior and code structure:

**Reachability queries** (graph-native):
- Find every caller of this function across 300 files
- Trace untrusted input from HTTP entry point to database sink without passing a validator
- Find all circular dependencies that block microservice extraction
- Detect dead code with no reachable callers from any entry point

**Runtime + structure joins** (relational):
- Find DB queries averaging >100ms in traces, identify missing indexes, generate migrations
- Find all symbols that throw unhandled exceptions in production traces
- Add caching to expensive computations identified from OTel span duration data

**Browser runtime queries** (CDP):
- Find CSS rules with zero matches across real user journeys, remove with certainty
- Diff server vs client component output to locate hydration mismatches
- Trace re-render cascades to their responsible symbols and memoize atomically

These query types cover most of what a senior engineer does day to day — not just writing
code but reasoning about a codebase at scale.

---

## Feedback loop

The system closes the full agent feedback loop across five layers:

- **CST** — valid structure enforced at schema level; lossless roundtrips via concrete
  syntax tree (comments, trivia preserved)
- **LSP** — type and semantic errors caught before commit
- **REPL** — server-side runtime behavior validated during development
- **CDP** — browser runtime behavior captured and traced; completes the full stack
- **OTel traces** — execution history from both REPL and CDP queryable as data,
  enabling session replay across server and browser

All traces — server OTel spans and browser CDP traces — land in the same `traces` table.
Agent queries runtime behavior across the full stack in one place: server latency, browser
paint time, and JS exceptions all joinable against the symbol graph.

---

## SDLC

The system adds a faster inner loop. It does not replace existing outer loops. Every
existing gate — linters, type checkers, test suites, CI pipelines — still fires against
real materialized files, unchanged. The graph layer means code is already well-validated
by the time it reaches those gates.

**The six-step flow:**

```
1. query    → understand reality (graph + traces)
2. REPL/CDP → grow solution against real data (red → green)
3. commit   → persist to graph atomically (LSP clean, unit tests pass)
4. swarm    → scale across codebase in one transaction
5. pre-commit hook → existing gates fire against materialized files
6. CI       → integration, e2e, deploy (unchanged)
```

Steps 1–4 are agent-native and new. Steps 5–6 are existing tooling, parasitized cleanly.

**Red/green in this system:**

Traditional TDD specifies behavior before implementation using invented fixtures. Here
the OTel trace table is a library of real inputs that already caused real behavior in
production. Red/green stops being "does it pass my imagined inputs" and becomes "does it
pass what production actually threw at it."

```
write symbol: processPayment (interface only)
query traces: find all real inputs that hit this path
REPL: run test against symbol → red (not implemented)
      grow implementation until green against real inputs
commit: symbol + implementation + test as one atomic transaction
```

Unit tests live in the REPL loop, pre-commit, validated against real data. Integration
tests live post-commit in the materialized sandbox. That boundary is enforced by the
architecture, not by convention.

**Git compatibility:**

The pre-commit hook materializes files and runs whatever checks the project already has.
Git sees a conventional file tree. CI sees a conventional file tree. No changes required
to existing pipelines. Teams adopt the graph layer without touching their infrastructure.

---

## Use cases

These are the scenarios that best demonstrate the value of the full system. Each one
represents a class of work that currently takes a senior engineer hours or days. Here
each is a query pipeline producing structured data at every step.

---

**Add input validation to all untrusted entry points**

The canonical security audit. Currently: a senior engineer reads code paths manually,
guesses at edge cases, writes tests against invented inputs. Here:

```
graph_query   → find every path from HTTP entry point to DB sink
                with no validator node in between (reachability)
REPL          → draft validator
              → red: unguarded input reaches DB
              → test against real traced production inputs — not invented fixtures
              → green
commit        → validator to graph, LSP confirms types hold everywhere
swarm         → insert validator at every unguarded path, one transaction
pre-commit    → eslint, tsc, existing test suite fire against materialized files
CI            → integration tests, docker build, deploy
```

You are not imagining edge cases. You are replaying what production actually sent. The
swarm step scales a validated solution across the entire codebase atomically — no
partially-patched state possible.

---

**Fix SSR hydration mismatch**

Hydration mismatches are among the hardest frontend bugs to locate. You see the error
but finding which data diverges between server and client requires manual bisection.
This is the scenario where CDP and the server REPL working together is uniquely powerful:

```
CDP session   → capture SSR HTML at server render time
              → capture client hydration attempt
              → record exact DOM node where mismatch fires
trace_query   → find exception span, stack frame, component symbol
graph_query   → find that component
              → query all data sources it reads server-side vs client-side
              → find symbols that return different values in each context
REPL          → eval component in Node context → capture output
CDP           → eval same component in browser context → capture output
              → diff the two outputs, isolate diverging symbol
              → fix: make data fetching context-agnostic
              → replay hydration → no mismatch → green
commit        → graph
pre-commit    → tsc confirms types hold
CI            → SSR integration test suite
```

Neither the REPL nor CDP alone gets you here. The diff between two evals against the
same symbol in two different runtime contexts is what collapses a multi-hour debug
session into a single query.

---

**Add DB indexes for all slow query patterns found in traces**

The canonical performance audit. Currently: manually profile, manually read query plans,
manually write migrations, manually verify improvement. Here:

```
trace_query   → find spans averaging >100ms, grouped by query pattern
graph_query   → find emitting symbols, identify unindexed columns
REPL          → draft migration
              → materialize sandbox DB
              → replay slow traced queries against it
              → new spans confirm duration dropped
              → green
commit        → migration to graph
pre-commit    → existing migration linting fires
CI            → integration tests run against migrated schema, deploy
```

You ship an index you already measured fixing the problem. The evidence is in the traces
before you write a line. The validation is in new traces before you commit.

---

## Live development

The REPL is not a validation step bolted onto the graph. It is a peer to the graph —
two views of the same program, one structural and persistent, one live and exploratory.

```
eval: define a new function → exists in runtime immediately
eval: call it with real traced inputs → see actual behavior
eval: refine → redefine in place
commit: when satisfied → write back to graph
```

The graph is the save state. The REPL is the workspace. Commit is the gesture that moves
work from the live runtime into the persistent graph. You grow the program from inside a
live runtime and persist when confident — the Clojure REPL model, applied to TypeScript
and Python, grounded in real production data.

CDP extends this to the browser. Every interaction, every component state, every network
request is traceable and replayable. Server and browser become two REPL contexts over
the same symbol graph.

---

## Smaller models on larger codebases

The system externalizes exactly the capabilities smaller models lack on large codebases:

- "What will break if I change this?" — graph query, not file reading
- "Where is this defined?" — symbol lookup, not grep
- "Is this change globally consistent?" — LSP pre-commit, not hope

Instead of dumping files into context, an agent queries for exactly what it needs.
`symbol_query("processPayment")` returns definition, callers, and type dependencies —
fits in context regardless of repo size. The graph does the navigation. The model
handles reasoning and generation.

The floor rises dramatically even if the ceiling stays the same. Smaller, cheaper, faster
models become reliably safe on large codebases. This may be the most practically valuable
property of the system.

---

## Storage

One database holds the full working state. Four tables:

- `files(id, path, language)` — materialization targets; import boundary markers
- `nodes(id, file_id, kind, parent_id, start, end, properties)` — every CST node
- `symbols(id, name, kind, definition_node_id, version)` — cross-file semantic index
- `traces(id, span_id, parent_span_id, name, start_time, end_time, attributes JSON)`
  — OTel spans from REPL and CDP traces; full-stack runtime behavior alongside code

File boundaries matter only as import contracts and materialization paths. Inside the DB
they are foreign keys, not organizing principles. A cross-file refactor is a query across
`file_id`s. Moving a function between files is `UPDATE nodes SET file_id = ?`.

**Graph vs relational:** code structure and traversal queries are native graph operations.
Runtime behavior (traces, aggregates, joins) is native relational. V1 uses SQLite —
pragmatic, embedded, ships fast. V2 evaluates Kuzu (embedded graph DB, Cypher queries,
zero-infra) with DuckDB alongside for relational and trace queries. The materialization
layer is decoupled from storage and stays identical across the swap.

---

## Concurrency

`symbols.version` is the concurrency primitive. Any mutation to a symbol's name,
signature, or type increments its version. Second writer on the same symbol sees a
version mismatch and aborts. New reference insertions are non-conflicting and compose
freely.

**V1 gap:** write-write conflicts detected; read-set staleness is not. Mitigated by
mandatory pre-commit LSP re-validation. Full OCC via transaction manifest deferred to V2.

Abort returns a conflict error. Retry policy is caller-defined.

---

## Lifecycle

```
git clone
    ↓
hydrate: parse source → populate graph (tree-sitter; low seconds for 50k-line repo)
    ↓
agents work in graph: query, mutate, validate, eval, trace
    ↓
materialize: graph → chosen projection (file tree, API spec, service split, etc.)
    ↓
git commit → DB discarded
```

Git is the durable save state. The DB is ephemeral, per-session, never committed.
Worktrees are reflink copies of the DB file plus a corresponding git worktree — branching
is a filesystem primitive on CoW filesystems (btrfs, APFS, ZFS).

---

## Editing flow

Every structural edit:
1. Mutates the graph in the DB
2. Materializes a fresh text buffer (deterministic tree walk, low single-digit ms)
3. Pushes buffer as `textDocument/didChange` to keep LSP virtual document consistent

For editor-integrated LSP (OpenCode, Cursor): write materialized file to actual worktree
path on commit; file watcher handles LSP sync naturally.

---

## Snapshots

`snapshot_restore` is a three-system reset: quiesce REPL pool → DB rollback → LSP
didClose all affected (batch) → materialize T1 source → LSP didOpen all affected (batch)
→ mark REPL sessions dirty. Two-phase batch ensures LSP rebuilds from consistent state.
Savepoints are SQLite-native; no GC required.

---

## CLI and MCP surface

```bash
# lifecycle (humans + CI)
ast-sqlite hydrate
ast-sqlite worktree add --branch <n>
ast-sqlite worktree materialize [--target openapi|files|services]
ast-sqlite worktree discard
```

```typescript
// agent tools (MCP)
session_init()                    // file tree + symbol graph
symbol_query(name)                // definition + references
node_mutate(fileId, mutation)     // structural edit + LSP validation
eval(expression, language)        // materialize + REPL + OTel
cdp_session(url)                  // attach browser runtime + capture traces
snapshot_create(name)
snapshot_restore(id)
materialize_to_sandbox(fileIds)   // for fs-native tool runs
hydrate_from_sandbox(path, paths)
trace_query(sql)                  // query OTel + CDP spans
graph_query(cypher)               // V2: native graph traversal
```

`.mcp.json` in the repo root enables automatic agent discovery via any MCP-aware client.

---

## Language scope (V1)

**TypeScript** — ts-morph / compiler API (trivia-preserving, CST by default). LSP via
tsserver.

**Python** — libcst required; stdlib `ast` strips comments and cannot be used. LSP via
pyright.

Each additional language requires a CST-capable parser, schema, materializer, and LSP
integration.

---

## Validation strategy

Build incrementally. Kill fast. Each phase gates the next.

**The single most important experiment:** Haiku + graph tools vs Opus + context dumping
on navigation-heavy tasks. If smaller models with graph access don't achieve comparable
results at meaningfully lower cost, the economic argument for the whole system collapses.
Everything else is contingent on that holding.

**Phase 1 — Core engine (week 1)**

One TypeScript file. One symbol. Parse → graph → query. If `symbol_query` can't return
accurate callers in under 500ms, stop. Also gate on roundtrip correctness here, not later
— `materialize(hydrate(src)) == src` must hold before anything else is built on top. A
broken roundtrip compounds silently and poisons every subsequent phase.

**Phase 2 — Agent query validation (weeks 2-3)**

Add MCP tools. Run the model equivalence test. Measure token cost reduction.

**Phase 3 — Trace + graph joins (weeks 3-5)**

Add OTel ingestion. Run the performance audit scenario against seeded slow queries. Run
the security audit scenario against known unvalidated paths. Measure recall.

**Phase 4 — REPL + live development (weeks 5-7)**

Add eval. Test red/green against real trace fixtures vs invented ones. Test the SSR
hydration mismatch scenario against a codebase with a known bug.

**Phase 5 — Full system (weeks 7-10)**

Swarm atomicity, pre-commit hook overhead, git compatibility end-to-end.

**Kill criteria:**

| Phase | Kill criterion | Decision |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Hydration > 30s for 10k LOC | Stop |
| 1 | Roundtrip not lossless | Re-architect before proceeding |
| 1 | Caller query accuracy < 95% | Re-architect parsing |
| 2 | No token cost advantage vs context dumping | Reconsider agent model |
| 3 | Trace queries not faster than manual audit | Rethink approach |
| 4 | REPL latency > 5s | Not viable for live dev |
| 5 | Materialization breaks CI | Fix or abandon |

**Known hard problems to expect:**

The REPL model has friction on impure code — side effects, database state, async races.
The sandbox model helps but doesn't fully solve it. Tree-sitter hydration doesn't resolve
dynamic imports or decorators (that's the LSP's job), but module resolution across
monorepos with hoisting will surface edge cases. Materialization correctness on
pathological CST structures will produce long tail bugs. These are expected, not
surprises.

---

## What this is not

A replacement for Git, a new version control system, or a tool for humans editing code
directly. Git handles history. Humans work normally. The graph layer exists only for the
duration of a swarm session, then discards itself. The materialized output is a
conventional project tree any existing CI pipeline consumes unchanged.

The shift is not in how code is stored long-term. The shift is in what becomes possible
during the session when agents have a queryable graph instead of a pile of text files.
